THE FOLDERS
===========
The Java1 folder contains a version of SmallXMLParser that works with JDK1.1
The Java2 folder contains a version of SmallXMLParser that works with new versions of Java (Java2 on up)

ONLY NEED ONE
=============
If you are not sure which one to use, definitely use the one from Java2 folder.  
The Java1 version is for those rare (maybe non-existent) people that are cursed to be using a super old (pre 2000) version of Java.
